# IRPNM
This code uses inexact regularized proximal Newton method to solve ell1-regularized Student’s t-regression,
group penalized Student’s t-regression, and nonconvex image restoration.

Please run setup.m in the Matlab command window.

For example, see test_dct.m, test_dctGP.m and test_image.m.
